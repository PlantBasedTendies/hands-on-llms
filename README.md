In this iteration, I've replaced Falcon 7B Instruct with the currently-SOTA (Jan '24) Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, \
fine-tuned using Unsloth on an expanded dataset of financial questions and answers generated with the help of \
GPT-4, quantized and augmented with a 4bit QLoRa. \

\
Prompt analysis and model registry is handled by Comet LLM, and finance news is streamed via Bytewax using an \
Alpaca API, then parsed, cleaned, and chunked with unstructured, and finally sent as a vector embedding to \
Qdrant's serverless vector store. LangChain chains the prompt and most relevant news article with real-time \
finance information, contextualizing the output. \
\
#TODO: Add citations to output to show end-user which article has been used to generate the output. \

I have contributed to the original (MIT licensed, ka-ching!) course which can be found here: \
