\
This is an invaluable 3-part production-ready FTI feature-training-inference RAG-framework LLMOps course by \
Paul Iusztin, Pau Labarta Bajo, and Alexandru Razvant. \
\
In this iteration, I've replaced Falcon 7B Instruct with the currently-SoTa (Jan'24) Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, \
fine-tuned using Unsloth on an expanded dataset of financial questions and answers generated with the help of \
GPT-4, quantized and augmented with a 4bit QLoRa. \
\
Prompt analysis and model registry is handled by Comet LLM, and finance news is streamed via Bytewax using an \
Alpaca API, then parsed, cleaned, and chunked with unstructured, and finally sent as a vector embedding to \
Qdrant's serverless vector store. LangChain chains the prompt and most relevant news article with real-time \
finance information, contextualizing the output. \
\
#TODO: Add citations to output to show end-user which article has been used to generate the output. \
\
I have contributed to the original MIT licensed (ka-ching!) course which can be found here: \
